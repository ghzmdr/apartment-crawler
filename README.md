This software is for educational purposes only.

It's a PhantomJS based crawler that is set up to look in FB groups and Kamernet (Dutch housing website), filter listings and organize the results in a compact and detailed list in HTML page for you to browse.


At it's current state it isn't 100% working, I edited many personal details and isn't straightforward to configure. Also I'm not updating this since 2016, and don't intend to, so many things may be changed but I still think it's a good ground for reference.
